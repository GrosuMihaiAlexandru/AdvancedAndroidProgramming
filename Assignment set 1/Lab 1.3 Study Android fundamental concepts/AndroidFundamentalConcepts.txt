1. What programming languages you can use for Android app development?
    - Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages.
2. What is .apk file?
    - An .apk file (Android package) is an archive file which contains all the contents of an Android app. It is the result of the compilation of code along with any
    data and resource file.
3. How Android system runs apps?
    - It runs like a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user with a unique Linus user ID. Each process has its own virtual machine, so all apps
    run independently from other apps. The android system starts a Linux process when any of the app components must be executed and shuts down the process when it's
    no longer needed or when the system has to recover memory for other apps.
4. Name four types of Android components. Describe each.
    - activities: an activity is a single screen with a user interface. 
    - services: a service is a component that runs in background to perform a long-running operation or work for remote processes.
    Unlike an activity, services don't have a UI.
    - broadcast receivers: a brodcast receiver is a component which delivers events to the app without the user interaction. It allows the app to respond to system-wide
    broadcast announcements. The system can deliver broadcasts even to apps which are not running.
    - content providers: content providers manage access to a central repository of data.
5. What is manifest file and what is its purpose?
    - The manifest is a file in which all the app components must be declared and must be at the root of the app project directory. It also contains user permissions,
    declares the minimum api, declares hardware and software used or required by the app and declares the API libraries the app needs to be linked against.
6. What are resources? Why they are needed?
    - Resources are files such as images, audio files, and anything relating to the visual presentation of the app. 
    - Using app resources makes it easy to update various characteristics of your app without modifying code. Providing resources enables you to optimize the app for a
    variery of of device configurations, like different languages and screen sizes.
